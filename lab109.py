# myValue = 1

# print(myValue)

# Print the data type of myValue
# print(type(myValue))\

# print(str(myValue) +  " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))


# FLOAT
# The int data type only stores whole numbers. If you want to store a number with a decimal, like 3.14, you need a new data type called a float.

# myValue = 3.14

# print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)));


# Complex
# In advanced math, an imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number that is multiplied by the imaginary unit i. 
# This complex data type is complicated because it must represent a letter and a number, such as 5j.

# myValue = 5j

# print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

# BOOLEAN

myValue = True

print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
