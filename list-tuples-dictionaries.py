# List
myFruitList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# myFruitList[0] = "orange"

# print(myFruitList)
# print(str(type(myFruitList)))

# Accessing a list

# print(myFruitList[0]);

# Tuple
# The tuple is like a list, but it can't be changed. A data type that 
# can't be changed after it's created is said to be immutable. To define a tuple, you use parentheses instead of brackets ([]).

# Same to const in JavaScript

myFinalAnswerTuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")


# print(myFinalAnswerTuple)
# print(str(type(myFinalAnswerTuple)))
# print(myFinalAnswerTuple[0])


# Dictionary
# A dictionary is a list with named positions (keys). Imagine that your list shows peopleâ€™s favorite fruit.

myFavoriteFruitDictionary = {
    "Akua": "apple",
    "Joseph": "banana",
    "Paulo": "orange"
}

# print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary)
# print(str(type(myFavoriteFruitDictionary)))

# Accessing Dictionary
Akua = myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Akua"]

print(Akua)
